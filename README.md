Just an initial note: 

This challenge was enough motivation for me to learn React. Its something I have been wanting to learn. 
My experience in frontend development is limited to Angular and some Vue - so if some of the coding principles seem a bit odd it's because this was honestly my first web app built with React with no prior experience. Juggling work and family I had night to  get the bulk of the work done so there is definately some room for improvement.

A couple of things I would have liked to do, if I had given myself more time:
- Investigate proper use of state management and possibly use Redux
- Move some of the data to a backend
- Persist client state in localStorage
- Optimise CSS and move to SASS
- Responsive design

I will definately do some if these things regardless.

I'd say this was a refreshing experience.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
